# CodeForces Practice

Welcome to my CodeForces practice repository! This repository contains solutions to various problems I have attempted on [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com). Each solution is implemented in **C++** and is accompanied by a link to the original problem statement on the CodeForces website.

## Structure

- Each `.cpp` file represents the solution to a specific problem.
- The file names follow a pattern based on the problem name or code for easy identification.
- Each file includes a comment at the top with a link to the problem it solves.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a record of my problem-solving practice on CodeForces. It reflects my ongoing efforts to improve my programming and algorithmic skills.
